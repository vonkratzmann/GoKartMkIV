    Maximum speed 15km/hour in forward direction
    Maximum reverse speed is half the maximum forward speed

/** System Harwdare Summary
   System consists of:
   Two 12v DC motors
   A joystick connected to two 10 bit ADCS, forwards 0 to 511,backwards 512 to 1023
   On/Off switch
   12V DC battery
   Microprocessor - Arduino Uno running a ATmega328
   Driver Printed Circuit Boards for the two DC motors
   8v DC power supply for the microprocessor
   Each motor via a sprocket drives a chain to the two rear wheels

   The program reads the joystick at a preddefined rate
   then converts these readings into a Pulse width Modulated output and direction to drive the motors direction and speed

   Uses counter 2 and interrupts to generate fast mode pwm pulses, freq is 1.960kHz
   Normal operation the diagnostic led fashes on and off every second via the ISR

   There are a number of simple diagnostics which can be enable by the #DEFINEs in GoKartMkIII.h
*/

/** Software Structure Overview
   The system consists of 6 files:
    GOKartMKIV.ino:  Variable declarations, oject definitions, ISR, Setup and main loop
    GOKartMKIV.h:    Diagnostic definitions, I/O and constants
    joystick.cpp:  Joystick class member functions
    joystick.h:    Joystick class decelerations
    motor.cpp:     Motor class member functions
    motor.h:       Motor class decelerations

    The main loop logic for the x axis is:
    check if time to flash the onboard led on or off, used to show program and isr are running
    check if time to read the joystick, then
    check if x axis of joystick has changed and check if y axis of joystick has changed by calling "check_X_Axis()" and "check_Y_Axis()"

    if either one has changed process the change,
    as y changes speed forwards or backwards, always process y before x
    use the y speed to firstly set the speed and direction for either forwards or backwards by calling process_Y()
    the reverse speed maximum has a seperate limit to the forward speed to prevent moving in reverse too quickly
    then use x to increase or decrease the speed of the left or right wheels to enable turning by calling process_X()
    to turn slow down the wheel of the direction you want to turn and leave the other wheel unchanged

    Note the value of X is scaled as a percentage of the current y speed to limit turning rate.

    Then calls:
      "left_Motor.update_Speed() to update motor speed from the requested speed
      "left_Motor.updateDir()" to update motor direction from the requested direction
      "right_Motor.update_Speed()" to update motor speed from the requested speed
      "right_Motor.updateDir()" to update motor direction from the requested directio
