/** System Parameters
    Maximum speed is a nomimanted speed,
      maximum physical speed is function of motor, gearing and wheel diameter
      Motor loaded rpm range: 2600 3000 rpm, Average 2800 rpm
      Motor sprocket 9 teeth
      Drive wheel sprocket 68 teeth
      Drive wheel diameter 250mm
      Maximum physical speed = 2800 * 9 / 68 * (3.141 * .250) / 1000 * 60 = 17.5 km/hr
    Maximum reverse speed is a nominated fraction of the nominated maximum forward speed
*/

/** System Harwdare Summary
   System consists of:
   Two 12v DC motors
   A joystick connected to two 10 bit ADCS, forwards 0 to 511,backwards 512 to 1023
   On/Off switch
   12V DC battery
   Microprocessor - Arduino Uno running a ATmega328
   Driver Printed Circuit Boards for the two DC motors
   8v DC power supply for the microprocessor
   Each motor via a sprocket drives a chain to the two rear wheels

   The program reads the joystick at a preddefined rate
   then converts these readings into a Pulse width Modulated output and direction to drive the motors direction and speed

   Uses counter 2 and interrupts to generate fast mode pwm pulses, freq is 1.960kHz
   Normal operation the diagnostic led fashes on and off every second via the ISR

   There are a number of simple diagnostics which can be enable by the #DEFINEs in GoKartMkIII.h
*/

/** Software Structure Overview
   The system consists of 6 files:
    GOKartMKIV.ino:  Variable declarations, oject definitions, ISR, Setup and main loop
    GOKartMKIV.h:    Diagnostic definitions, I/O and constants
    joystick.cpp:  Joystick class member functions
    joystick.h:    Joystick class decelerations
    motor.cpp:     Motor class member functions
    motor.h:       Motor class decelerations

    The main loop logic for the x axis is:
    check if time to flash the onboard led on or off, used to show program and isr are running
    check if time to read the joystick, then
    check if x axis of joystick has changed and check if y axis of joystick has changed by calling "check_X_Axis()" and "check_Y_Axis()"

    if either one has changed process the change,
    as y changes speed forwards or backwards, always process y before x
    use the y speed to firstly set the speed and direction for either forwards or backwards by calling process_Y()
    the reverse speed maximum has a seperate limit to the forward speed to prevent moving in reverse too quickly
    then use x to increase or decrease the speed of the left or right wheels to enable turning by calling process_X()
    to turn slow down the wheel of the direction you want to turn and leave the other wheel unchanged

    Note the value of X is scaled as a percentage of the current y speed to limit turning rate.

    Then calls:
      "left_Motor.update_Speed() to update motor speed from the requested speed
      "left_Motor.updateDir()" to update motor direction from the requested direction
      "right_Motor.update_Speed()" to update motor speed from the requested speed
      "right_Motor.updateDir()" to update motor direction from the requested directio

   Slot detector ISR
   interrupts on change of state of input from slotted wheel sensor
   does a quick check for noise by ensuring pulses are above a specified size, if not ignore that pulse
   when a slot is under the sensor, the signal is high
   on rising edge records the time in microseconds
   on a falling edge, check how long it has been in the high state and if the sensor has been stable in the high state ie for the debounce period
   says that a valid slot has been under the sensor, calculates the time between slots, and sets the flag for the main loop to read and process
   Uses function micros() rather than millis() as with some disks with 100 slots the time between slots is only a few milliseconds.
