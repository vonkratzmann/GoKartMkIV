 *  Maximum speed 15km/hour in forward direction

/** System Harwdare Summary
   System consists of:
   Two 12v DC motors
   A joystick connected to two 10 bit ADCS, forwards 0 to 511,backwards 512 to 1023
   On/Off switch
   12V DC battery
   Microprocessor - Arduino Uno running a ATmega328
   Driver Printed Circuit Boards for the two DC motors
   8v DC power supply for the microprocessor
   Each motor via a sprocket drives a chain to the two rear wheels

   The program reads the joystick at a preddefined rate
   then converts these readings into a Pulse width Modulated output and direction to drive the motors direction and speed

   Uses counter 2 and interrupts to generate fast mode pwm pulses, freq is 1.960kHz
   Normal operation the diagnostic led fashes on and off every second via the ISR

   There are a number of simple diagnostics which can be enable by the #DEFINEs in GoKartMkIII.h
*/

/** Software Structure Overview
   The system consists of 6 files:
    GOKartMKIV.ino:  Variable declarations, oject definitions, ISR, Setup and main loop
    GOKartMKIV.h:    Diagnostic definitions, I/O and constants
    joystick.cpp:  Joystick class member functions
    joystick.h:    Joystick class decelerations
    motor.cpp:     Motor class member functions
    motor.h:       Motor class decelerations

    The main loop logic for the x axis is:
    check if time to flash the onboard led on or off, used to show program and isr are running
    check if time to read the joystick, then
    check if x axis of joystick has changed and check if y axis of joystick has changed by calling "check_X_Axis()" and "check_Y_Axis()"

    if either one has changed process the change,
    as y changes speed forwards or backwards, always process y before x
    use the y speed to firstly set the speed and direction for either forwards or backwards by calling process_Y()
    the reverse speed maximum has a seperate limit to the forward speed to prevent moving in reverse too quickly
    then use x to increase or decrease the speed of the left or right wheels to enable turning by calling process_X()
    to turn slow down the wheel of the direction you want to turn and leave the other wheel unchanged

    Note the value of X is scaled as a percentage of the current y speed to limit turning rate.

    Then calls:
      "left_Motor.update_Speed() to update motor speed from the requested speed
      "left_Motor.update_Dir()" to update motor direction from the requested direction
      "right_Motor.update_Speed()" to update motor speed from the requested speed
      "right_Motor.update_Dir()" to update motor direction from the requested directio

  /* Timer 0, is 8 bits used by fuction millis();
    Timer 2, is 8 bits and is used to generate an interrupt approximately every 500 microseconds and to process pwm pulses to motors
    Timer is 16x10^6 (clock speed) / [prescaler x 255];  for prescaler of 32, frequeny of interrupts and PWM is 1.960kHz
    Use fast PWM mode, where the timer repeatedly counts from 0 to 255. The output turns on when the timer is at 0, and turns off when the timer matches the output compare register OCR2A and OCR2B.
    The higher the value in the output compare register, the higher the duty cycle.
